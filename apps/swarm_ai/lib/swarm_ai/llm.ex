  @moduledoc """
  Protocol for LLM integration.

  Implement this protocol for your LLM client struct to provide streaming
  responses to the SwarmAi execution loop. The only required function is
  `stream/3`, which returns a lazy enumerable of `ReqLLM.StreamChunk.t()`.

  Batch-style responses can be built from the stream via `SwarmAi.LLM.Response.from_stream/1`.

  Stream LLM response as chunks.

  This is the primitive operation - batch responses are built via
  Response.from_stream/1. Returns a lazy enumerable of ReqLLM.StreamChunk.t().
