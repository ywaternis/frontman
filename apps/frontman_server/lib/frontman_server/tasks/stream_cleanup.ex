defmodule FrontmanServer.Tasks.StreamCleanup do
  @moduledoc """
  Ensures LLM streaming connections are released when the consuming process
  dies unexpectedly (cancellation, crash).

  ## Problem

  `ReqLLM.stream_text/3` returns a `cancel` function that releases the
  underlying Finch HTTP connection. If the process consuming the stream is
  killed (e.g. via `Process.exit(pid, :cancelled)`), the cancel function is
  never called and the connection is leaked back into the Finch pool only
  after the provider-side timeout (up to 150 s with our `receive_timeout`).

  Under concurrent load this exhausts the connection pool.

  ## Solution

  `wrap_stream/2` uses two complementary mechanisms:

  1. **`Stream.transform` after callback** — fires on normal completion,
     `Enum.take` halt, and raise during consumption. Calls `cancel_fn`
     directly (idempotent) and signals the cleanup process to stand down.

  2. **Linked cleanup process** — traps exits from the caller. If the
     caller dies before the stream's after callback fires (e.g.
     `Process.exit(pid, :cancelled)`), the cleanup process calls
     `cancel_fn` as a safety net.

  The cancel function is idempotent, so double-calling is harmless.

  require Logger

  @doc """
  Wraps a stream with connection cleanup tied to the calling process lifecycle.

  Returns a new stream that behaves identically to `stream` but guarantees
  `cancel_fn` is called when:

  - the stream is fully consumed
  - the stream is partially consumed (e.g. `Enum.take`)
  - an error is raised during consumption
  - the consumer process is killed before consumption completes

  ## Parameters

    - `stream` — the lazy chunk stream from ReqLLM
    - `cancel_fn` — 0-arity function that releases the underlying connection.
      Typically `response.cancel` from `ReqLLM.stream_text/3`.
