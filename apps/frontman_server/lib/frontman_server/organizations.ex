defmodule FrontmanServer.Organizations do
  @moduledoc """
  Manages organizations and team membership.

  Organizations are workspaces that group users together. Each user can belong
  to multiple organizations with different roles (owner, member).

  ## Organization Lifecycle
  - Users create organizations and become the owner
  - Owners can invite other users as members
  - Organizations are accessed via URL slug (e.g., /orgs/my-team)

  ## Authorization
  All functions require a Scope. Functions operating on a specific organization
  expect the organization to be set in the scope (via FetchOrganization plug).
  Owner-only operations will raise MatchError if the scoped user lacks permission.
