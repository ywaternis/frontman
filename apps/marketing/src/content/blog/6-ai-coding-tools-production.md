faq:
  - question: 'Which AI coding tool is best for non-engineers?'
    answer: 'Frontman. It runs in the browser and lets you select elements visually. You don''t need to know your way around an IDE or terminal.'
  - question: 'Can I use more than one of these tools together?'
    answer: 'Yes. Frontman handles visual/UI changes in the browser, while an IDE tool like Cursor or Claude Code handles backend logic, refactors, and migrations. They complement each other.'
  - question: 'Which tool has the best free tier?'
    answer: 'Cline and Frontman are both free and open-source. You pay for the AI model usage (BYOK), but the tools themselves cost nothing.'
  - question: 'Do any of these tools work with my existing codebase?'
    answer: 'All of them do. That was the selection criteria for this list. They all handle existing, production codebases rather than only generating greenfield projects.'
  - question: 'How do framework-aware AI tools differ from general-purpose ones?'
    answer: 'Framework-aware tools like Frontman integrate at the framework level (Next.js, Astro, Vite), so they understand your routing, component tree, and build system. General-purpose tools treat your code as text files.'

You open your laptop on a Monday morning. There's a button on the homepage that's supposed to be blue. It's gray. The designer filed a ticket two weeks ago. The developer has three higher-priority items in the sprint. You can see exactly what's wrong, but you can't fix it.

This is the moment I've lived through dozens of times. I'm a product manager at a mid-stage startup. I understand the product, I know what it should look like, and I have access to the codebase. But every visual change requires a developer, a ticket, a code review, and a deployment. The latency between "I see the problem" and "the user sees the fix" is measured in days or weeks.

If you're dealing with the same thing, [Frontman](https://frontman.sh) is the tool we built to fix it. It's an AI agent that runs in your browser alongside your app, so you can select an element and describe what you want changed. More on that below.

I've spent the past year testing every AI coding tool on the market, looking for one that lets me actually edit production code without needing a developer in the loop. They all generate new code from scratch fine. I needed something harder: a tool that can navigate an existing codebase, understand the context, and make targeted changes that work.

Here's what I cover in this post:

- **[Frontman](#1-frontman)** — browser-based AI agent for visual UI work (our pick)
- **[Cursor](#2-cursor)** — the most capable AI-native IDE
- **[Claude Code](#3-claude-code)** — terminal-first, massive context window
- **[Windsurf](#4-windsurf)** — session-level Flow awareness at $15/mo
- **[GitHub Copilot Edits](#5-github-copilot-edits)** — lowest friction if you're already on GitHub
- **[Cline](#6-cline)** — open-source with browser automation
- **[Comparison table](#comparison-table)** — side-by-side pricing, type, and best-for

If your search is specifically frontend UI work, start with the [best frontend coding agent](/blog/best-frontend-coding-agent/) guide instead; it compares frontend-specific workflows, browser context, React UI generation, and reviewable diffs.

## 1. Frontman

Every other tool on this list lives in an IDE or terminal. [Frontman](https://frontman.sh) is the exception: it's an open-source AI agent that hooks into your dev server as middleware and runs alongside your application in the browser.

The workflow:

1. Select an element in your browser (a button, a card, a section)
2. Describe what you want changed ("make this button larger," "stack this card on mobile")
3. Frontman edits the source code and you see the result immediately

It has access to the live DOM, your component tree, CSS styles, routes, and server logs. It supports Next.js, Astro, and Vite (with React, Vue, or Svelte). Because it integrates at the framework level, it reads your actual stack rather than guessing from raw files.

The limitation: Frontman is scoped to frontend work. It won't help you refactor a backend service or write database migrations. If you need that, pair it with one of the IDE-based tools below.

The target user is a designer or product manager who needs to make visual changes without opening an IDE.

It's open-source (Apache 2.0), free to self-host, and BYOK: you connect your own API key from Anthropic, OpenAI, or OpenRouter.

Get started in your project folder:

```bash
# Next.js
npx @frontman-ai/nextjs install

# Astro
astro add @frontman-ai/astro

# Vite (React, Vue, Svelte)
npx @frontman-ai/vite install
```

Frontman is also available as an [OpenClaw skill](/blog/frontman-openclaw-skill/), so you can use it from Slack, Telegram, or Discord through your OpenClaw agent.

**Best for:** Designers and product managers who need to make visual changes in the browser without waiting for engineering.

## 2. Cursor

The first time [Cursor](https://cursor.sh) worked well, I was refactoring authentication across a Next.js app. I opened the agent, typed "convert this to use the new OAuth provider," and watched it touch eleven files in sequence. It knew which components depended on which. It didn't break the build. The changes were correct on the first try.

Cursor is a fork of VS Code, which means the AI runs inside the editor itself rather than as an extension on top. The Tab feature predicts entire blocks of code rather than single lines. It picks up on your component patterns, naming conventions, and file organization. After a week in a project, it feels like it knows the codebase as well as you do.

The pricing shifted to a credit-based system in mid-2025. Heavy agent usage can run up unexpected costs. Stick to Auto mode, which routes simple tasks to cheaper models, and keep an eye on the usage dashboard if you're running many multi-file tasks.

**Best for:** Developers who want the most capable AI-native IDE and don't mind managing credit usage.

## 3. Claude Code

I used [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) to untangle a legacy module that nobody on the team wanted to touch. The module had no tests, inconsistent naming, and business logic embedded in React components. I pasted the entire directory (3,000 lines) into the context window and asked "what does this do?"

It answered with a three-paragraph summary that was more accurate than the documentation we had. Then I asked it to refactor the business logic into a service layer. It did it in forty minutes, running tests as it went.

Claude Code lives in the terminal. That's the constraint and the advantage. You can feed it massive contexts (1 million tokens, roughly 750,000 words) and it holds the whole picture. It integrates via MCP, an open standard for connecting AI to external tools. If you can script it, Claude Code can orchestrate it: database migrations, API calls, deployment pipelines, whatever.

If you prefer visual file navigation, a GUI debugger, or your existing VS Code setup, this won't work. But for developers comfortable in the terminal, it's the most powerful tool on this list.

**Best for:** Terminal-native developers who want maximum context and are comfortable scripting their workflows.

## 4. Windsurf

The thing I remember most about [Windsurf](https://windsurf.com) is a forty-minute coding session where I never had to re-explain my task. I jumped from a bug in the user service to a layout issue in the frontend to a failing test, and the Flow system remembered what I was working on the whole time. It tracked my editing session as a continuous narrative instead of isolated prompts.

Windsurf is a VS Code fork like Cursor. The difference is Flow awareness: it maintains context across your entire coding session, including previous conversations. The Cascade agent handles multi-file edits, runs tests, and iterates until things work.

Cognition (the company behind Devin, the autonomous coding agent) acquired Windsurf in mid-2025. The product has remained intact, and under new ownership it regained access to Anthropic's Claude models, which it had briefly lost during the acquisition turbulence.

At $15/month, it's cheaper than Cursor. If you find Cursor's credit system confusing, Windsurf's more straightforward model might appeal.

**Best for:** Developers who want solid IDE features at a lower price point, with Flow awareness that tracks their work across sessions.

## 5. GitHub Copilot Edits

[Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) has 20 million users globally. Ninety percent of Fortune 100 companies use it. If you're in the Microsoft ecosystem, Copilot is already in your editor (VS Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains) with nothing to install.

The Agent mode in Copilot Chat handles multi-file edits now. It's less sophisticated than Cursor or Windsurf, but it's effective, and it's already there. The Edits feature lets you make changes across multiple files, review them as diffs, and accept or reject each change individually.

At $10/month for Pro (or $100/year), it's half the price of Cursor. The Pro+ tier at $39/month gives you access to Claude Opus 4 and OpenAI o3, so you get frontier models without the premium IDE features.

The limitation is depth. Copilot's codebase awareness isn't as deep as Cursor's, and the agentic capabilities feel more like helpful suggestions that apply to multiple files rather than true autonomous editing. But for teams already on GitHub, it's the lowest-friction path to AI-assisted coding.

**Best for:** Teams already in the Microsoft/GitHub ecosystem who want basic AI assistance at the lowest price.

## 6. Cline

The moment [Cline](https://cline.bot) impressed me, I was debugging a CSS issue. I asked Cline to spin up the dev server, navigate to the broken page, take a screenshot, identify the problem, fix it, and verify the result. It did all of that autonomously. I watched it work like a junior developer sitting next to me, clicking through the browser while talking through what it was doing.

Cline is an open-source VS Code extension (Apache 2.0 licensed). The tool is free; you connect your own API key from Anthropic, OpenAI, or Google, or run local models via Ollama. With 5 million installs and 59,000 GitHub stars, it's the most popular open-source AI coding agent. It raised $32M in Series A funding, so it's not going away.

Browser automation is the differentiator. Cline interacts with your running application in a way the other tools on this list don't. It can see what's rendered on screen, take screenshots, and act on what it finds.

The trade-off is managing your own API costs. Cline shows real-time usage and estimated costs per task, but there's no spending cap. If you're comfortable with pay-per-token pricing, it's the most flexible option.

**Best for:** Developers who want open-source flexibility, model choice, and browser automation without subscription lock-in.

## The bottom line

For editing code in an IDE or terminal, any of the six tools above work. Pick Cursor for the deepest codebase awareness. Claude Code if you live in the terminal. Windsurf for session-level context at $15/mo. Copilot if your team is already on GitHub. Cline if you want open-source and browser automation.

For visual UI work, where you're looking at a running app and thinking "this needs to look different," those tools all require you to round-trip between the browser and the editor. Frontman removes that round-trip by running where the visual work already happens: in the browser.

Try it on your project:

```bash
# Next.js
npx @frontman-ai/nextjs install

# Astro
astro add @frontman-ai/astro

# Vite (React, Vue, Svelte)
npx @frontman-ai/vite install
```
