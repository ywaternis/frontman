faq:
  - question: 'What is the difference between Frontman, Cursor, and Claude Code?'
    answer: 'Cursor and Claude Code are AI coding agents built for engineers — they read source code, run terminal commands, and reason about multi-file changes. Frontman is a browser-based agent built for visual work — it sees the live page, lets you click the element you want to change, and traces it back to the source file automatically. Designers and PMs use Frontman to update spacing, colors, typography, and copy directly, without needing to navigate the codebase.'
  - question: 'Can designers and PMs use Frontman without knowing how to code?'
    answer: 'Yes. Frontman works in the browser — you click the element you want to change and describe what you want in plain language. You do not need to know which file to edit, what the class names mean, or how the component tree is structured. Frontman traces the visual element back to the source code and makes the edit for you. Changes go through the same code review process as any other PR.'
  - question: 'Will I break something if I make changes with Frontman?'
    answer: 'Frontman edits the same source files your engineers work in, and every change goes through your existing review process — pull requests, CI checks, design review. You cannot deploy a broken change without someone approving it. The risk is the same as any other code change, with the same guardrails.'
  - question: 'Is Frontman only for trivial CSS changes?'
    answer: 'No. Spacing, typography, responsive layout, color systems, and component styling account for 30-40% of frontend work. Each individual change may be small, but the category is large. Multi-select lets you batch many visual fixes in one pass, and handling these changes directly means your engineering team can focus on structural work instead of pixel-pushing tickets.'
  - question: 'Can Claude Code or Cursor take screenshots to see the UI?'
    answer: 'They can, through browser automation plugins. But a screenshot is a flat image — it strips away the component structure, the design tokens, the responsive breakpoints, and the state. The agent has to guess what it is looking at. Frontman reads the live page directly and knows which component renders which element because it is connected to your framework, not scraping pixels.'

You have seen your engineering team use Cursor or Claude Code. The demos are impressive — they write functions, refactor entire modules, wire up APIs. So you tried it yourself. You wanted to fix the spacing on a card component. Update a button color to match the new brand palette. Change some copy on the landing page.

It dropped you into a code editor. You were looking at a file called `CardGrid.tsx` with nested `div` elements and class names like `p-4 md:p-8 lg:p-12`. The agent asked you to describe the problem in text. You typed "the card has too much padding on mobile." It changed something. You switched to the browser. Wrong element. You tried again, with more detail. It changed something else. Still wrong. You gave up and filed a Jira ticket.

This is not a skill issue. Cursor and Claude Code are built for engineers who think in code. They are excellent at that. But if you think visually — if you _see_ the problem on the page and just want to point at it — these tools do not work the way you work.

> **TL;DR:** Cursor and Claude Code are built for engineers — they read code, run commands, and reason about files. Frontman is built for visual work — you click the element you want to change, describe what you want, and it handles the code. Designers and PMs use Frontman for spacing, colors, typography, and copy. Engineers use their preferred coding agent for everything else. Everyone reviews PRs through the same process.

## Why Coding Agents Do Not Work for Visual Tasks

Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, and Copilot are file-level agents. They read source code, understand how files connect, and edit across multiple files at once. For engineering work — writing functions, refactoring, building APIs — they are transformative.

But they have a fundamental limitation — [the runtime context gap](/blog/runtime-context-gap/): they cannot see the rendered page. They do not know what your design system components look like at a given screen size. They cannot tell which of three nested containers you are looking at. When you ask them to fix something visual, they edit the file and hope — this is fundamentally [why coding agents are blind to your UI](/blog/ai-coding-agents-blind-to-ui/). The verification step — "did it actually work?" — is entirely on you. You switch to the browser, look, switch back, try to describe what you see in words, and hope the agent infers what you meant.

For someone who lives in Figma or reviews builds in the browser, this is backwards. You can _see_ the problem. You should be able to point at it.

## How Frontman Works Differently

Frontman connects to your running app in the browser. Instead of starting from code, you start from the page — the same way you already review designs.

When you click an element in Frontman:

- It sees the **live page** — the actual rendered result, not a source file
- It understands the **visual properties** — the real spacing, colors, and typography as they appear on screen
- It traces the element back to the **exact source file and component**, automatically
- It applies the change and you see the result **immediately** — no switching tabs, no re-describing the problem

You do not need to know which file to open. You do not need to know the class names or the component hierarchy. You point at the thing that needs to change, say what you want, and Frontman handles the rest. See [how Frontman works differently](/blog/frontman-launch/) for the full architecture.

## The Same Change, Two Workflows

Your design system specifies 16px padding on cards at mobile breakpoints. A recent update broke it — cards now have 32px. You need to fix it across the product.

**What happens when you try Cursor or Claude Code:**

```text
You: "Fix the card padding on mobile in CardGrid.tsx"
Agent: *reads the file, changes a class on line 23*
You: *switch to browser* — still wrong, it changed the outer wrapper
You: "It's the inner container, not the outer one"
Agent: *reads the file again, edits line 31*
You: *switch to browser* — padding is fixed but desktop layout broke
You: *give up, file a ticket for engineering*
```

**What happens in Frontman:**

```text
You: *click the card in the browser* "Padding should be 16px on mobile"
Frontman: *sees the current padding is 32px, traces to CardGrid.tsx:31*
         *updates the class, change appears immediately*
```

The difference is not intelligence. Both agents are capable. The difference is that one can see what you are looking at and the other cannot.

## Who Should Use What

| Task | Who does it | Tool | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fix spacing to match design specs | Designer | **Frontman** | Visual task — click, describe, done |
| Update copy and CTAs on the marketing site | PM | **Frontman** | Content change, see it live before merging |
| Adjust brand colors across components | Designer | **Frontman** | Design system change, needs visual verification |
| Build a new API endpoint | Engineer | Cursor, Claude Code | Pure code, no visual output |
| Refactor the authentication flow | Engineer | Cursor, Claude Code | Multi-file structural change |
| Fix responsive layout issues flagged in QA | Designer or Engineer | **Frontman** | Visual problem at specific screen sizes |
| Debug a state management bug | Engineer | Cursor, Claude Code | Deep code reasoning |
| Align production UI with updated Figma specs | Designer | **Frontman** | Visual QA, point at what is wrong |

The pattern: if "correct" means _it looks right in the browser_, use the tool that can see the browser. If "correct" means _the tests pass_ or _the types check_, use the tool that reasons about code.

## What About Breaking Things?

This is the first question every designer and PM asks, and it is the right one.

Frontman edits the same source files your engineers work in. Every change produces a real code diff. That diff goes through your existing review process — pull requests, CI checks, automated tests, design review. Nothing ships without approval.

You are not pushing to production. You are opening a PR. The same guardrails that protect the codebase from a junior engineer's first commit protect it from your changes too. Your engineering team reviews the code. You review the visual result. The process works because it is the same process.

## Common Questions

**"Do I need to set up a development environment?"**
Your engineering team sets up Frontman once — it connects to the dev server that is already running. After that, you open the browser and start working. No terminal, no IDE, no environment setup.

**"Can't I just use Figma's Dev Mode or handoff tools?"**
Handoff tools describe _what should change_. Frontman _makes the change_. Instead of annotating a screenshot with "padding should be 16px" and waiting for an engineer to pick up the ticket, you click the element, say "padding 16px," and open a PR. The feedback loop drops from days to minutes.

**"Why not just ask an engineer? It only takes them five minutes."**
It takes them five minutes of coding. But it takes a day of context-switching, ticket grooming, sprint planning, and waiting. Multiply that by every spacing fix, copy change, and color update across your design system, and you are looking at a significant chunk of engineering time spent on work that does not require engineering judgment. Let your engineers build features. Handle the visual layer yourself.

**"What if the change I want is more complex than a style tweak?"**
Then it is probably an engineering task. Frontman is not trying to replace your engineering team. It handles the visual layer — spacing, typography, colors, layout, responsive behavior, copy. The work where the acceptance criterion is _how it looks_. When the change involves logic, data flow, or architecture, that belongs in Cursor or Claude Code with your engineers.

**"Claude Code can take screenshots to see what the page looks like."**
It can, through browser automation plugins. But a screenshot is a flat image — it strips away the component structure, the design tokens, the responsive breakpoints, and the interactive state. The agent has to guess what it is looking at and reverse-engineer the structure from pixels. Frontman reads the live page directly. It knows which component renders which element because it is connected to your framework. There is nothing to guess.

## The Takeaway

You tried the AI coding agents. They are powerful, but they were not built for how you work. They think in files. You think in what you see on the page. That is not a limitation of yours — it is a limitation of theirs.

Frontman is the tool that meets you where you are. Click what needs to change. Describe what you want. Review the result in the browser. Open a PR. Your engineering team stays focused on engineering. Your design system stays consistent. And you stop waiting three sprints for a padding fix.
