OpenAI released GPT-5.4 yesterday. Today, you can use it in Frontman.

If you're managing a design system across multiple teams, this model matters. GPT-5.4 can hold your entire design system documentation, component specs, and conversation history in a single session — and it's better at translating visual intent into production-ready implementation.

### What Changes for Your Workflow

**Your full design system in context, all at once.** GPT-5.4 supports up to one million tokens — roughly 750,000 words. That's enough to hold your component library docs, spacing and typography tokens, brand guidelines, and the current task all in one session — while [keeping your code safe](/blog/security/) with Frontman's local-only architecture. No more re-explaining your system's conventions halfway through a build.

**It can see and operate your browser.** GPT-5.4 has built-in computer-use capabilities that complement Frontman's [runtime context](/blog/runtime-context-gap/). It navigates your app, clicks through flows, and visually verifies that implementations match your specs. When your team ships a new component, Frontman can check that it actually looks right — not just that the code compiles.

**Smarter tool usage across your stack.** Teams at scale use a lot of tools — Figma plugins, design token pipelines, CI checks. GPT-5.4 is significantly better at finding and using the right tool for the job without you having to guide it step by step. Less hand-holding, more shipping.

**Faster reasoning, same quality.** GPT-5.4 solves problems with fewer intermediate steps than previous models. For you, that means quicker turnaround on component builds, layout adjustments, and responsive implementations. The back-and-forth shrinks.

**Stronger frontend output.** Compared to models powering other [AI coding tools](/blog/6-ai-coding-tools-production/), GPT-5.4 is noticeably better at complex frontend work — producing more polished, visually accurate results. Design system components come out closer to spec on the first pass, which means fewer review cycles between your design and engineering teams.

### How to Use It

GPT-5.4 is now the default for ChatGPT OAuth users in Frontman. If you've connected your ChatGPT Pro or Plus account, it's already available in the model picker.

OpenRouter users can select GPT-5.4 or GPT-5.4 Pro from the model dropdown. Pro offers stronger performance on research-heavy and abstract reasoning tasks — useful when you're working through complex interaction patterns or auditing system-wide consistency.

No setup needed. Open Frontman, pick the model, start building.

### Why This Matters for Growing Teams

Every team that scales past two or three squads hits the same problem: the [design system starts drifting](/blog/ai-coding-agents-blind-to-ui/). Components get re-implemented slightly differently. Spacing breaks. Brand consistency erodes one PR at a time.

GPT-5.4 in Frontman helps close that gap. It holds your entire system in memory, sees what's actually rendered in the browser, and builds with your conventions — not generic defaults. The model gets better, and your system stays tighter.
