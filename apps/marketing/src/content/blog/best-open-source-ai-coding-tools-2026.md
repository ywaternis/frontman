faq:
  - question: 'What are the best open-source AI coding tools in 2026?'
    answer: 'The most popular open-source AI coding tools by GitHub stars are OpenHands (68k stars, MIT), Cline (58k, Apache 2.0), Aider (41k, Apache 2.0), Tabby (33k, Apache 2.0), Goose (32k, Apache 2.0), Continue (31k, Apache 2.0), archived Roo Code (22k, Apache 2.0), and bolt.diy (19k, MIT). Each targets a different workflow: Aider and Goose are CLI-based, Cline and Roo-style forks are VS Code agents, Tabby is self-hosted autocomplete, and OpenHands is a full agent platform.'
  - question: 'What is the best open-source alternative to Cursor?'
    answer: 'Void (28k stars) was the most direct open-source Cursor alternative as a VS Code fork, but the project paused development in 2025. Active alternatives include Cline (58k stars) as a VS Code agent with BYOK, Continue (31k stars) for IDE integration, and Aider (41k stars) for terminal-based pair programming. Roo Code was archived in May 2026, so evaluate maintained Roo-style forks instead. For visual frontend editing specifically, Frontman and Stagewise take a browser-based approach instead of the IDE approach.'
  - question: 'What is the best open-source alternative to GitHub Copilot?'
    answer: 'Tabby (33k stars) is the closest open-source alternative to GitHub Copilot. It provides self-hosted code completion for VS Code and JetBrains with support for local models. Continue (31k stars) also offers autocomplete and chat as a VS Code/JetBrains extension. Both are Apache 2.0 licensed and support BYOK.'
  - question: 'Which open-source AI coding tools support BYOK (bring your own key)?'
    answer: 'Most major open-source AI coding tools support BYOK: Aider, Cline, Kilo Code, Goose, Continue, Frontman, and bolt.diy all let you connect your own API keys to Claude, OpenAI, OpenRouter, or other providers. Roo Code supported BYOK before it was archived in May 2026. Tabby supports local models. Stagewise requires its own account for the built-in agent but can bridge to IDE agents.'
  - question: 'Are there open-source AI coding tools that work in the browser?'
    answer: 'Yes. Frontman (frontman.sh) and Stagewise (stagewise.io) both let you click elements in your running web app and describe changes in natural language. Frontman installs as framework middleware for Next.js, Astro, and Vite. Stagewise is a CLI overlay that injects a toolbar. bolt.diy runs a full cloud IDE in the browser for generating new apps from scratch.'
  - question: 'What are the best open-source AI CLI coding tools in 2026?'
    answer: 'The two leading open-source CLI coding tools are Aider (41k stars, Apache 2.0) and Goose (32k stars, Apache 2.0). Aider is a terminal-based pair programmer with deep git integration — it auto-commits changes and supports any LLM via BYOK. Goose, built by Block, combines a CLI with a desktop app and supports MCP for extensibility. Both run locally and work with any editor. Claude Code is another popular terminal agent but is proprietary, not open-source.'
  - question: 'How do Aider, Cline, and Roo Code compare in 2026?'
    answer: 'Aider (41k stars) is a CLI tool — you run it in the terminal and it edits files with git integration. Cline (58k stars) is a VS Code extension that acts as an autonomous coding agent with human-in-the-loop approval. Roo Code (22k stars) forked from Cline and added a multi-mode system (Code, Architect, Ask, Debug) for structured workflows, but it was archived in May 2026. The choice depends on your workflow: terminal (Aider), VS Code with approval gates (Cline), or a maintained Roo-style fork if you specifically want structured modes.'
  - question: 'What are the best BYOK AI coding tools in 2026?'
    answer: 'BYOK (bring your own key) tools let you connect your own API keys to Claude, OpenAI, OpenRouter, or other providers instead of paying a tool subscription. The best active BYOK options are: Aider (CLI, 41k stars), Cline (VS Code, 58k stars), Kilo Code (VS Code + JetBrains, 16k stars), Goose (CLI + desktop, 32k stars), Continue (IDE + CLI, 31k stars), Frontman (browser-based, Apache 2.0), and bolt.diy (cloud IDE, 19k stars). Tabby supports local models instead of API keys. Roo Code supported BYOK before it was archived.'
---

The best open-source AI coding tool in 2026 depends on your workflow: use Aider or Goose for terminal agents, Cline or Kilo Code for IDE-based agents, Tabby for self-hosted autocomplete, OpenHands for autonomous agent platforms, and Frontman or Stagewise for browser-based visual editing.

There are over a dozen open-source AI coding tools that have gained serious traction in 2026. They range from terminal pair programmers to full agent platforms to browser-based visual editors that bridge the [runtime context gap](/blog/runtime-context-gap/). This is a factual comparison of every major one, organized by architecture category. We built Frontman (one of the tools listed), so we'll note that where relevant and call out where other tools are stronger.

## Cline vs Roo Code vs Kilo Code vs OpenHands

If you're choosing between the highest-intent 2026 AI coding agents, the short version is this:

| Tool | Best fit | Main tradeoff |
|------|----------|---------------|
| Cline | VS Code users who want the largest open-source agent community | Approval-heavy workflow can feel slow |
| Roo Code | Teams that liked Cline-style agents with structured modes | Original project was archived in May 2026 |
| Kilo Code | Developers who want a Cline-family agent with JetBrains support | Newer project with overlapping features |
| OpenHands | Teams evaluating full autonomous agent platforms | Broader scope, more complex self-hosting |

Cline is the safest default for an open-source VS Code AI coding agent in 2026. Roo Code is still useful as a reference point because many teams compare Roo Code vs Cline, but the archived status changes the adoption calculus. Kilo Code is the Cline-family option to watch if JetBrains support matters. OpenHands is not a drop-in editor assistant; it is closer to an open-source Devin-style agent platform.

## CLI-Based Open-Source AI Coding Tools

### Aider

[aider.chat](https://aider.chat) | 41,200 stars | Apache-2.0

Terminal-based AI pair programmer. You run `aider` in your project directory and chat with it. It maps your repo structure, edits files directly, and auto-commits changes to git. Written in Python. Works with any LLM via BYOK.

Aider has scored consistently well on SWE-bench (the standard benchmark for AI code editing). It has 93 releases and 13,100+ commits as of March 2026. For developers who prefer working in the terminal over a GUI, it's the most mature option.

It works with any editor and has excellent git integration (auto-commits with sensible messages). The tradeoff: it's terminal-only with no visual interface, can't see a running application, and repo mapping can hit memory limits on very large monorepos.

### Goose

[block.github.io/goose](https://block.github.io/goose) | 32,300 stars | Apache-2.0

Built by Block (the company behind Square and Cash App). Goose is a local AI agent with both a CLI and a desktop app. It goes beyond code suggestions: install dependencies, run commands, execute tests, edit files. MCP integration for extensibility.

Corporate backing from Block means long-term maintenance is likely. The desktop app makes it accessible to non-terminal users, and MCP support lets it connect to external tools. It's still rough around the edges for complex multi-file refactoring compared to Aider, and relatively new despite the high star count.

## Open-Source AI IDE Extensions (VS Code & JetBrains)

### Cline

[github.com/cline/cline](https://github.com/cline/cline) | 58,600 stars | Apache-2.0

Autonomous coding agent that runs as a VS Code extension. Cline can create and edit files, run terminal commands, use a headless browser, and work with MCP tools. Every action requires human approval before execution, keeping you in the loop.

Cline spawned two major forks (Roo Code and Kilo Code) that have become independent projects. The original remains the most popular with 238 releases and an enterprise offering (SSO, audit trails) through Cline Bot Inc.

It has the largest community of any open-source coding agent, with human-in-the-loop approval for every action and support for every major LLM provider via BYOK. The approval workflow adds friction for routine operations, and quality depends heavily on which model you connect. VS Code only.

### Roo Code

[roocode.com](https://roocode.com) | 22,500 stars | Apache-2.0

Originally forked from Cline, Roo Code diverged into its own product. The main differentiator was a multi-mode system: Code mode for editing, Architect mode for planning, Ask mode for questions, Debug mode for troubleshooting, and customizable modes you define yourself. Backed by Roo Code, Inc.

The mode system gives more structured control over the agent's behavior than Cline's single-mode approach, and custom modes let teams define specialized workflows. 300 contributors as of March 2026. On the other hand, it's VS Code only, and the mode switching adds a mental model layer that some developers find unnecessary. Roo Code was later shut down and archived in May 2026; read the current [Roo Code vs Cline guide](/blog/roo-code-vs-cline/) before adopting it.

### Kilo Code

[github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilocode) | 16,200 stars | Apache-2.0

Another descendant of the Cline family, Kilo Code targets both VS Code and JetBrains. Claims over 1.5 million users and reports being the highest-volume consumer on OpenRouter. Positions itself as an "all-in-one agentic engineering platform."

The JetBrains support sets it apart (most Cline-family tools are VS Code only), and the high usage volume suggests stability at scale. It's newer and less documented than Cline or Roo Code, and the feature set overlaps heavily with its parent project.

### Continue

[docs.continue.dev](https://docs.continue.dev) | 31,600 stars | Apache-2.0

Continue started as an open-source Copilot alternative with autocomplete and chat in VS Code and JetBrains. It has since pivoted toward "AI checks in CI," a CLI tool that runs AI-powered code review checks in your CI pipeline. The IDE extension still exists but is no longer the primary focus.

451 contributors and 802 releases make it one of the most mature projects in this space. The CI pivot is interesting: enforcing code quality via AI at the pipeline level instead of the editor level. But the pivot also means the IDE experience may receive less attention going forward. If you want an IDE assistant, the Cline family or Tabby are more focused options.

## Self-Hosted Code Completion

### Tabby

[tabbyml.com](https://tabbyml.com) | 33,000 stars | Apache-2.0 (open-core)

Self-hosted AI coding assistant. Tabby provides code completion and chat for VS Code, JetBrains, and IntelliJ, running entirely on your own infrastructure. Written in Rust. Supports local models and has an answer engine that indexes your codebase.

For teams that can't send code to external APIs (regulated industries, air-gapped environments), Tabby is the primary option. Enterprise features (team management, SSO) require a separate license.

No code leaves your infrastructure, and the Rust implementation is fast. The tradeoff is that running local models requires meaningful GPU hardware, and smaller models produce noticeably worse completions than GPT-4 or Claude. Some features are behind an enterprise paywall.

## IDE Forks

### Void

[voideditor.com](https://voideditor.com) | 28,300 stars | Apache-2.0

Void was the most direct open-source alternative to Cursor: a full VS Code fork with built-in AI agents, change visualization, and BYOK model support.

**The project paused development in late 2025.** The README states: "We've paused work on the Void IDE to explore a few novel coding ideas... we might not resume Void as an IDE." They are not reviewing issues or PRs.

Void is worth mentioning because of its star count and because it validated demand for an open-source Cursor. But it's not an active project. If you're evaluating it, check the repo status before investing time.

## Agent Platforms

### OpenHands

[openhands.dev](https://openhands.dev) | 68,500 stars | MIT (open-core)

Formerly OpenDevin. OpenHands is a full AI-powered development platform with an SDK, CLI, local web GUI, and hosted cloud version. Agents can browse the web, write and execute code, manage files, and handle end-to-end development workflows.

Think of it as an open-source Devin. The scope goes well beyond code editor assistance into autonomous development. The cloud version offers a free tier with a Minimax model, and the enterprise version runs in your VPC.

Highest star count in the space, MIT license, 479 contributors. That broad scope is both the appeal and the risk: autonomous agents are powerful but unpredictable, and the self-hosting setup is complex. Enterprise features require a separate license.

## Browser-Based Tools

These tools take a different approach from everything above. Instead of working from source files in an IDE or terminal, these [browser-aware AI tools](/blog/browser-aware-ai-tools-2026/) connect to your running application in the browser.

### Stagewise

[stagewise.io](https://stagewise.io) | 6,500 stars | AGPL-3.0

YC-backed. `npx stagewise@latest` starts a proxy and injects a toolbar into your running web app. Click an element, describe the change, and either Stagewise's built-in agent or a bridged IDE agent (Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, Cline, Roo Code) generates the edit. Framework-agnostic: React, Next.js, Vue, Angular.

Zero install friction (no changes to your codebase), and the IDE agent bridge lets you route edits through Cursor or Copilot if you already use them. Framework-agnostic. YC-backed. The catch: 10 free prompts per day, 100/day for ~20/month. The built-in agent requires a Stagewise account with no true BYOK, and the proxy architecture gives it limited server-side context. See the full [Frontman vs Stagewise breakdown](/vs/stagewise/) for a detailed feature comparison.

### Frontman

[frontman.sh](https://frontman.sh) | ~131 stars | Apache-2.0 (client) / AGPL-3.0 (server)

*Disclosure: We built this.*

Frontman is an open-source AI coding agent that hooks into your dev server as framework middleware for Next.js, Astro, and Vite (React, Vue, Svelte). Because it installs inside the framework, it has access to things the proxy approach can't reach: component tree, computed styles, server-side routes, server logs, and compiled modules, all exposed via MCP. Click any element, describe the change, get a source code edit with hot reload.

Self-hostable under open-source licenses, with BYOK for Claude, OpenAI, or OpenRouter. Hosted Frontman plans are moving to paid subscriptions. Designers and PMs can make visual changes without touching an IDE — see [Frontman vs. Cursor vs. Claude Code](/blog/frontman-vs-cursor-vs-claude-code/) for a detailed breakdown.

It's early stage: small community, incomplete documentation, rough edges. Only three frameworks supported (Next.js, Astro, Vite). Source mapping breaks on deeply abstracted component libraries. 131 stars means limited real-world validation. [Getting Started with Frontman](/blog/getting-started/) covers the install process. Frontman is also available as an [OpenClaw skill](/blog/frontman-openclaw-skill/) for teams that use OpenClaw as their AI agent — see the [comparison](/vs/openclaw/).

### bolt.diy

[github.com/stackblitz-labs/bolt.diy](https://github.com/stackblitz-labs/bolt.diy) | 19,100 stars | MIT

The open-source version of Bolt.new. Generates and runs full-stack web apps in the browser using WebContainers. Supports 19+ LLM providers via BYOK. Electron desktop app available.

bolt.diy targets a different use case from Stagewise and Frontman. It generates new applications from scratch in a sandbox. The others edit existing codebases.

MIT license, 10,400 forks, and a desktop app for offline use. But the WebContainers API requires a commercial license for production/for-profit use, which undermines the MIT license promise. It generates in a sandbox rather than your real codebase, so it's less useful for iterating on existing projects.

## Coding Assistants vs. Coding Agents

The tools in this list fall into two broad categories. **Coding assistants** (Tabby, Continue) provide autocomplete, suggestions, and chat — they augment your typing. **Coding agents** (Aider, Cline, Roo Code, OpenHands, Goose, Frontman) take autonomous action — they edit files, run commands, and execute multi-step plans. Most modern tools are moving toward agents, but assistants are still valuable for low-friction inline help.

## BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) Tools

BYOK means you connect your own API keys to Claude, OpenAI, OpenRouter, or other providers instead of paying a per-seat tool subscription. This gives you cost control, model choice, no vendor lock-in, and the ability to keep code on your own infrastructure.

| Tool | BYOK Support | Notes |
|------|:---:|-------|
| Aider | Full | Any LLM provider |
| Cline | Full | Any LLM provider |
| Roo Code | Full | Any LLM provider |
| Kilo Code | Full | Any LLM provider |
| Goose | Full | Any LLM provider |
| Continue | Full | Any LLM provider |
| Frontman | Full | Claude, OpenAI, OpenRouter, any OpenAI-compatible API |
| bolt.diy | Full | 19+ providers |
| OpenHands | Full | Any LLM provider |
| Tabby | Local models | Self-hosted, no cloud API |
| Stagewise | Partial | Built-in agent requires account; IDE bridge for BYOK |
| Void | Full | Paused development |

See the [full feature matrix](/compare/) for a side-by-side comparison across all tools.

## How to Choose

The right tool depends on what you're trying to do:

**"I want AI autocomplete in my editor."** Tabby (self-hosted), Continue (cloud), or GitHub Copilot (proprietary, for comparison).

**"I want an AI agent in my terminal."** Aider for pair programming with git integration. Goose for broader task execution beyond just code.

**"I want an AI agent in VS Code."** Cline is the most popular. Kilo Code if you need JetBrains support. Evaluate a maintained Roo-style fork if you specifically want structured modes.

**"I want to click things in the browser and have AI edit the code."** These are [browser-aware AI coding tools](/blog/what-are-browser-aware-ai-coding-tools/). Frontman if you want deep framework integration and BYOK. Stagewise if you want zero-install and IDE agent bridging.

**"I want to generate a new app from a prompt."** bolt.diy or OpenHands. See the [Frontman vs v0 comparison](/vs/v0/) for how generative and iterative workflows differ.

**"I want a full autonomous developer agent."** OpenHands is the most complete option.

Many of these tools are complementary. Using Aider in the terminal doesn't prevent you from also using Frontman in the browser for visual tweaks. Using Cline in VS Code doesn't conflict with Tabby for completions. Pick the tools that match your specific workflow gaps.
