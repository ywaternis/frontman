faq:
  - question: 'What is vibe coding?'
    answer: "Vibe coding is the practice of generating code with an AI tool and shipping it without fully understanding what it does, relying on the fact that it looks right or passes tests. The term captures the feeling: you're going on vibes rather than engineering judgment."
  - question: "Isn't fast iteration better than slow, careful iteration?"
    answer: "Fast iteration on code you understand is better. Fast iteration on code you don't understand creates verification debt: the cost of all the checks you skipped. That debt compounds. The first three months feel like superpowers. Month six, you're debugging production fires caused by edge cases the AI didn't anticipate and you didn't catch."
  - question: "How is Frontman different from vibe coding tools?"
    answer: "Vibe coding tools generate new code and give it to you to ship. Frontman edits your existing code, the code you already understand and maintain. There is no generated codebase to become responsible for. Every change Frontman makes is a diff against code your team wrote and reviewed. You can read it, understand it, and own it."

Somewhere between late 2024 and now, "vibe coding" became shorthand for a real engineering practice: prompt an AI, ship what it generates, worry about understanding it later. The productivity gains are real. So are the consequences.

AI coding tools are genuinely useful. The problem is a specific failure mode, one that's invisible during the honeymoon period and expensive when it surfaces.

**Quick answer:** vibe coding breaks production apps when AI-generated code ships before the team understands, tests, and owns it. The issue is not speed by itself. The issue is verification debt: every assumption, edge case, and architecture decision you skipped while the demo looked good.

## What Verification Debt Is

When you ship code you don't understand, you create verification debt: the accumulated cost of all the checks you skipped.

Every line of code you own comes with an implicit question: "Do I understand what this does, under what conditions it fails, and what other things it touches?" When you write code yourself, you answer that question as you write. When you generate code and ship it, you defer it indefinitely.

Verification debt looks like:
- A function that works for the happy path but breaks on empty arrays in production
- A component that renders correctly in development but causes hydration errors at scale
- A database query that hits an unindexed column and runs fine until you have 50k rows
- Auth middleware that handles the documented flow but misses a redirect edge case the AI didn't know about

None of these are the AI's fault. They're the predictable result of shipping code before you understand it.

## The Anatomy of a Vibe-Coded Codebase

Three months of fast iteration on a greenfield project with an AI coding tool produces a specific kind of codebase. It's not bad code, exactly. It's *unfamiliar* code, generated to match the prompt, not to be understood by the person shipping it.

The inconsistency is the first thing you notice. The AI generates each feature independently, so the auth flow uses one pattern for error handling, the data layer uses another, and the components use a third. Nothing is wrong. Nothing is coherent. Refactoring later means understanding each piece from scratch.

Then there are the implicit assumptions. Generated code makes assumptions about its context: what shape the incoming data is, what state the application is in when the code runs. When those assumptions break, you have to reverse-engineer what the code was expecting before you can understand why it failed.

AI-generated tests have the same problem. They test the happy path, because that's what was in the prompt. The edge cases, the ones that actually cause production incidents, require knowing what might go wrong. You can't prompt for a test you haven't thought of.

And when something does break, you can't trace it. In a codebase you wrote, you follow the logic from input to output. In a vibe-coded codebase, each file is a black box. You know what it does (you prompted for it). You don't know *how* it does it.

## The Months 1–6 Arc

Here's the honest trajectory:

Month 1 is incredible. Features that would take weeks land in days. Demos look polished. Investors are impressed.

Month 2 brings some weird bugs. They get fixed by prompting the AI again. You don't fully understand the fix, but it seems to work.

Month 3 brings a production incident. The root cause is in a piece of generated code that was shipping fine until an edge case hit at scale. Debugging it takes longer than it should because no one fully understands the file.

By month 4, you've hired an engineer to "clean up the codebase." They spend the first two weeks just reading code. They say things like "I don't understand why this is done this way," and neither do you.

Month 5: new features are slower because every change carries the risk of breaking something in the generated codebase that nobody fully understands.

Month 6: you're doing the rewrite you swore you'd never do.

This is not hypothetical. It's the pattern.

## Why AI-Generated Code Is Specifically Risky

Static analysis catches some of what you'd catch by reading. Tests catch some of what you'd catch by thinking through edge cases. Neither catches the class of bug that comes from not understanding the code well enough to know what to test or analyze.

AI-generated code has specific failure modes worth understanding.

It optimizes for the prompt, not the system. A function generated to "fetch user data and handle errors" will handle the errors the AI considers typical. It will miss the error you'd catch if you thought carefully about all the ways this particular integration fails in your particular environment.

It doesn't know your operational context. The AI doesn't know your database has a 30-second query timeout. It doesn't know your CDN strips certain headers. It doesn't know your mobile users have spotty connections. Generated code doesn't account for things that aren't in the prompt.

The hardest problem: generated code is fluent without necessarily being correct. It reads like code written by a competent senior engineer. Code written by someone who doesn't know what they're doing usually *looks* like it was written by someone who doesn't know what they're doing. Generated code that is subtly wrong looks like code that's probably fine.

## The Discipline Hasn't Changed

Understanding what you ship is the standard. It's what makes code review worthwhile. It's why "don't commit code you don't understand" exists as a rule. It's why test-driven development has traction. AI didn't create the standard; it made violating it much easier.

Tools that let you work on your *existing* codebase, where every edit is a diff against code you already understand, don't create this problem. When Frontman edits a padding value in your `PricingCard` component, you can read the diff. You know what changed. You know why. You own it the same way you owned it before.

That's the difference between AI that augments your judgment and AI that replaces it.

## What to Actually Do

Use AI coding tools, but make the output earn its way into the codebase:

- Review the diff before shipping, not after a bug report.
- Add the edge-case tests you would have written by hand.
- Keep generated code inside your existing architecture instead of letting every feature invent a new pattern.
- Prefer targeted edits in code you already maintain over wholesale generated codebases you have to reverse-engineer later.

If you're building something new, treat AI output as a first draft. Review it before shipping. If you can't explain the diff to a colleague, it's not ready.

Write your own tests. Use the AI to scaffold them, but add the edge cases yourself. You know your system's failure modes better than the AI does.

And maintain a coherent architecture. AI tools generate whatever pattern is consistent with the context you give them. Prompt consistently, enforce a clear structure, and the generated code stays coherent.

If you're inheriting a vibe-coded codebase, start with behavior rather than code. Write integration tests that document what the system does before you touch anything. That gives you a safety net.

Then refactor to understand, not to improve. The goal isn't better code; it's code you can reason about. Isolate each component, read it, rewrite anything you don't understand in your own style.

And be honest about what you're dealing with. A codebase you don't understand is a liability. Put it on the roadmap as technical debt with a real cost, not "cleanup we'll get to someday."

The velocity gains from AI coding tools are real. So is the verification debt. Staying honest about both is how you capture one without getting buried in the other.
