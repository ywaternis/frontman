faq:
  - question: 'What is the main difference between Frontman and v0?'
    answer: 'v0 generates new components from a prompt or screenshot — you get brand-new code that you then integrate into your project. Frontman edits components that already exist in your codebase — you click them in the running browser and describe changes in plain language. v0 is for building new things. Frontman is for modifying what you have.'
  - question: 'Can I use v0 output and then edit it with Frontman?'
    answer: 'Yes. A common workflow is to use v0 to generate a starting point, integrate it into your project, and then use Frontman for ongoing visual iteration. Once the component is in your codebase, Frontman can click-to-edit it like anything else.'
  - question: "Does v0 understand my existing design system?"
    answer: "v0 can be prompted with your design tokens and component patterns, but it generates new code from scratch — it doesn't have access to your running application or component tree. Frontman edits your existing components directly, so it inherently respects whatever patterns they already follow."
  - question: 'Which one is better for a PM or designer?'
    answer: 'Frontman, for ongoing work on an existing product. You click elements in your running app, describe changes, and see them immediately. v0 requires knowing how to integrate generated components into an existing codebase, which is an engineering task.'

v0 and Frontman both use AI to change what your UI looks like. They're not competing for the same job.

v0 is a generation tool. You give it a prompt or a screenshot and it produces a new component. Bolt, Lovable, and similar tools work the same way: they create code that doesn't exist yet.

Frontman is an editing tool. You click an element in your running application and describe what you want to change. It edits the code that already exists.

The difference matters more than it sounds.

## The Generated Code Problem

When you use v0 to build a component, you get code you didn't write. That's the point; it saves you the writing. But code you didn't write is code you now have to maintain.

Maintenance costs compound. Every generated component you integrate becomes part of your codebase. When it breaks, you debug it. When your design system changes, you update it. When it drifts from your conventions, you fix it. The time you saved generating it comes back as maintenance time.

That's just how codebases work.

When Frontman edits an existing component, none of this applies. The component was already there. Your team already understands it. The diff is small and reviewable. Nothing new was introduced to your codebase; something that already existed was changed.

## The Same Use Case, Two Approaches

Your marketing site has a pricing section. The cards need more visual separation, more breathing room between them.

### Using v0

```text
You: *screenshot the pricing section, prompt v0*
v0: *generates a new PricingCard component with adjusted spacing*
You: *download the generated code*
You: *open your codebase, find your existing PricingCard*
You: *compare the two, extract just the spacing changes*
You: *apply them to your actual component*
You: *verify nothing broke with the rest of the design system*
Time: 20-40 minutes if you're comfortable with the codebase
```

### Using Frontman

```text
You: *click a pricing card in the browser*
You: "Add more vertical spacing between cards"
Frontman: *reads current gap value, edits the component source*
You: *see the change immediately via hot-reload*
You: *open PR*
Time: 2 minutes
```

The v0 workflow requires an engineer to integrate generated code into the existing codebase. The Frontman workflow doesn't, because there's no generated code to integrate. The edit happens directly.

## Who v0 Is Built For

v0 works best for greenfield work. Building something from scratch? It generates a working starting point in seconds. If you want to show stakeholders three different layout options before committing to any of them, v0 is what you want. Design exploration, rapid prototyping, projects with no existing codebase to worry about. Those are v0's territory.

## Who Frontman Is Built For

Frontman is for existing production applications. You have a running app with real users and you want to change what's there, not build something new.

That means spacing tweaks, typography adjustments, color updates, responsive fixes. The UI already works; you're refining it. Designers and PMs use it because they can see what needs to change but can't find the file to change it in. They click the element, describe what they want, and Frontman edits the source.

It also handles design system maintenance. Frontman knows which component renders which element, so changes stay coherent across your system without generating new code that might drift from it.

## The Design System Coherence Issue

This is where v0 and Frontman diverge most sharply in practice.

Your design system has conventions: spacing values, a color palette expressed as tokens, typography settings, interaction patterns. Components that follow these conventions compose correctly. Components that don't create inconsistency.

v0 generates code that uses *some* design system conventions (the ones you included in your prompt) but lacks knowledge of all the others. A generated component might use your color tokens but hardcode font sizes instead of using your type scale. It renders correctly but drifts from the system.

Frontman edits components that already follow your conventions, because they're already in your codebase. It doesn't generate anything new. It changes what's there, within the patterns already established. The design system stays coherent because nothing new was introduced.

For a team maintaining a production design system, that's the difference that shows up in code review six months later.

## The Honest Comparison

| Question | v0 | Frontman |
|---|---|---|
| Building something new? | **Best choice** | Not the right tool |
| Editing existing components? | Roundabout | **Best choice** |
| Works in running browser? | No | **Yes** |
| Connects to your framework? | No | **Yes** |
| Usable by non-engineers? | Requires integration | **Yes, directly** |
| Maintains design system? | Requires care | **Inherently** |
| Output requires code review? | Yes (new code) | Yes (diff of existing code) |

## Using Both

The tools are complementary. A practical workflow:

1. Use v0 to generate the component from scratch.
2. Review and integrate the generated code (engineering task).
3. Use Frontman for ongoing iteration once the component is in your codebase.

This is the pattern many teams land on. v0 for creation. Frontman for maintenance and iteration.

Once code is in your codebase and reviewed, use a tool that can see your running application and edit it directly. Generation is for when nothing exists yet.
