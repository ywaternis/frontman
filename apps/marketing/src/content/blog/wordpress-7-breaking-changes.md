faq:
  - question: 'Should I update to WordPress 7 right away or wait?'
    answer: 'Wait at least 2-4 weeks after GA. Let the plugin ecosystem catch up. Run a staging audit first using the checklist in this post, and have a rollback plan ready before touching production.'
  - question: 'Will my plugins work with WordPress 7?'
    answer: 'It depends on the plugin. Any plugin that uses classic meta boxes, WP_List_Table hooks, or the Interactivity API effect() function will need updates. Check your plugin developers release notes for WordPress 7 compatibility statements.'
  - question: 'What PHP version does WordPress 7 require?'
    answer: 'PHP 7.4 minimum. If your hosting runs PHP 7.2 or 7.3, the auto-updater will skip WordPress 7 entirely and keep you on 6.9. You need to upgrade PHP first.'
  - question: 'How do I roll back from WordPress 7 to 6.9?'
    answer: 'Restore from a full backup (files + database) taken before the upgrade. The WP-CLI downgrade method works but does not revert database schema changes. Always test the rollback process on staging first.'
  - question: 'What breaks in WordPress 7?'
    answer: 'The biggest breaking changes are: the iframed editor (breaks meta boxes and admin JS), Block API Version 3 enforcement, the Interactivity API effect-to-watch rename, DataViews replacing groupByField, and the PHP 7.4 minimum requirement.'
  - question: 'Is WordPress 7 safe to install?'
    answer: 'WordPress 7 is stable core software, but the breaking changes are significant. The risk is not WordPress itself crashing — it is your plugins, themes, and custom code breaking silently. Test on staging with your full plugin stack before upgrading production.'
  - question: 'How to test WordPress 7 before updating?'
    answer: 'Create a staging copy of your production site with identical plugins, theme, and PHP version. Install WP7 on staging. Run through critical user flows: post editing, WooCommerce checkout (if applicable), form submissions, and any custom admin screens. Check the browser console for deprecation warnings.'
  - question: 'WordPress 7 real-time collaboration — do I need it?'
    answer: 'Real-time collaboration is opt-in per post type. If your site has a single author or you do not co-edit posts simultaneously, you will not notice a difference. The feature generates roughly 480 requests per minute per editing session, which may stress shared hosting.'

Every WordPress 7 upgrade guide says "test on staging." None of them say what to do when the test fails. We dug through 12 dev notes, Trac tickets, and plugin developer reports to build the audit and rollback playbook that every other guide skips.

WordPress 7 is the largest core release since Gutenberg landed in WordPress 5.0. The [delay from April to mid-to-late May 2026](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2026/03/31/extending-the-7-0-cycle/) bought extra time for the real-time collaboration database architecture, but the breaking changes shipped as planned. There are six categories of them, and they affect different parts of your stack in different ways.

This post covers each breaking change, the fix for it, and what to do if the fix isn't feasible for your site right now.

## What's actually changing in WordPress 7

Before getting into the individual breaking changes, here's the scope. WordPress 7 touches:

- **The editor architecture** (iframed by default, Block API Version 3)
- **State management** (Interactivity API rewrites)
- **Admin UI framework** (DataViews replacing legacy list tables)
- **PHP floor** (7.2 and 7.3 dropped)
- **Block registration** (heading variations)
- **Collaboration infrastructure** (real-time editing, new database table)

Each of these affects a different audience. If you maintain custom blocks, the iframed editor is your biggest concern. If you run WooCommerce, plugin compatibility matters more than any single API change. If you manage client sites on shared hosting, the real-time collaboration overhead is worth understanding before it surprises you.

## Breaking change #1: The iframed editor and Block API Version 3

WordPress 7 [loads the post editor inside an iframe](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2026/02/24/iframed-editor-changes-in-wordpress-7-0/). This is the change that breaks the most plugins.

### What breaks

Any JavaScript that accesses `document` or `window` from the admin page and expects to reach editor content will fail. The editor DOM is now in a separate iframe, so `document.querySelector` in the parent frame returns nothing from the editor.

This affects:
- Classic meta boxes that read or write editor content
- Admin scripts enqueued via `admin_enqueue_scripts` (they load in the parent frame, not the iframe)
- Third-party libraries that hardcode `window` or `document` references
- CSS using viewport units (`vw`, `vh`) calculated against the admin dimensions instead of the editor

Blocks still on [`apiVersion: 2`](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-api-versions/) trigger a deprecation warning since WordPress 6.9. In WordPress 7, if all inserted blocks are version 3 or higher, the editor loads in the iframe. If any block is version 2 or lower, the iframe is removed entirely for that post. One outdated block disables the iframe for the whole editing session.

### How to fix it

**For block authors**, upgrade to `apiVersion: 3` in your `block.json` and replace all direct `document`/`window` access with `useRefEffect`:

```javascript
// Before (breaks in iframe)
useEffect(() => {
  document.addEventListener('click', handler);
}, []);

// After (works in iframe)
import { useRefEffect } from '@wordpress/element';

const ref = useRefEffect((element) => {
  const { ownerDocument } = element;
  const { defaultView } = ownerDocument;
  defaultView.addEventListener('click', handler);
  return () => {
    defaultView.removeEventListener('click', handler);
  };
}, []);

const blockProps = useBlockProps({ ref });
```

Use `useRefEffect` instead of `useEffect` with refs. Standard `useEffect` won't fire when the ref changes. `useRefEffect` will.

**For third-party libraries** (jQuery, Masonry, etc.), access them through the iframe's `defaultView`:

```javascript
const ref = useRefEffect((element) => {
  const { ownerDocument } = element;
  const { defaultView } = ownerDocument;

  if (!defaultView.jQuery) {
    return; // script not loaded in iframe yet
  }

  defaultView.jQuery(element).masonry({ /* options */ });
  return () => {
    defaultView.jQuery(element).masonry('destroy');
  };
});
```

**For scripts**, move them from `admin_enqueue_scripts` to `enqueue_block_editor_assets`. The former loads in the parent frame. The latter loads inside the iframe where the editor lives.

### How to roll back

If your plugins break and the authors haven't released updates:

1. Identify which blocks are still on `apiVersion: 2` — those are preventing the iframe from loading, which is actually protecting you temporarily
2. If all blocks are version 3 and the iframe is breaking your admin JS, you can force the legacy behavior by ensuring at least one registered block stays on `apiVersion: 2` (not recommended long-term, but buys time)
3. The actual rollback: restore from pre-upgrade backup. WP-CLI's `core download --version=6.9.x --force` replaces the files but does not revert database changes. If WordPress 7 ran any schema migrations, file-only rollback is not enough.

## Breaking change #2: Classic meta boxes disable collaboration

This one is subtle and affects more sites than people realize.

### What breaks

If any post type has classic meta boxes registered via `add_meta_box()`, the entire post type loses access to real-time collaboration. Not just the posts with meta boxes in them. The entire post type.

This means a single plugin registering a classic meta box on `post` disables collaboration for every post on your site.

### How to fix it

Migrate meta boxes to `register_post_meta()` with REST API support, then build the UI as a `PluginSidebar` component:

```php
// Before: classic meta box
add_meta_box('subtitle', 'Subtitle', 'render_subtitle_box', 'post');

// After: register as post meta with REST support
register_post_meta('post', 'subtitle', [
  'show_in_rest' => true,
  'single'       => true,
  'type'         => 'string',
]);
```

Then in JavaScript, create a sidebar panel that reads and writes the meta:

```javascript
import { PluginSidebar } from '@wordpress/editor';
import { TextControl } from '@wordpress/components';
import { useEntityProp } from '@wordpress/core-data';

function SubtitlePanel() {
  const [meta, setMeta] = useEntityProp('postType', 'post', 'meta');

  return (
    <PluginSidebar name="subtitle" title="Subtitle">
      <TextControl
        label="Subtitle"
        value={meta.subtitle || ''}
        onChange={(value) => setMeta({ ...meta, subtitle: value })}
      />
    </PluginSidebar>
  );
}
```

### How to roll back

You can't selectively roll back this change. It's architectural. If you need collaboration and have meta boxes, the fix is the migration above. If you don't need collaboration, the meta boxes continue working — they just block the new feature.

To audit which plugins register meta boxes, search your codebase and active plugins for `add_meta_box` calls:

```bash
grep -r "add_meta_box" wp-content/plugins/ --include="*.php" -l
```

## Breaking change #3: Interactivity API — effect() renamed to watch()

This is the silent killer. The function [was renamed](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2026/03/04/changes-to-the-interactivity-api-in-wordpress-7-0/), but the real risk is in the deprecated navigation state properties.

### What breaks

The `effect()` function in the Interactivity API is replaced by `watch()`. The old name works in 7.0 but may be removed in a future release.

More critically, `state.navigation.hasStarted` and `state.navigation.hasFinished` from `core/router` are deprecated. Accessing them triggers console warnings in development mode (`SCRIPT_DEBUG`), but in production, the warnings are silent. Your loading bars and navigation indicators will stop working with no visible error.

Also, `state.url` is now populated server-side during directive processing instead of client-side via `window.location.href`. Code that guards against `undefined` values on initial load will behave differently.

### How to fix it

Replace `effect()` with `watch()`:

```javascript
// Before
import { store, effect } from '@wordpress/interactivity';

effect(() => {
  sendAnalyticsPageView(state.url);
});

// After
import { store, watch } from '@wordpress/interactivity';

watch(() => {
  sendAnalyticsPageView(state.url);
});
```

For navigation state tracking, remove references to `state.navigation.hasStarted` and `state.navigation.hasFinished`. WordPress 7.1 will introduce the official replacement API. Until then, you can track navigation by watching `state.url` changes:

```javascript
const { state } = store('core/router');

watch(() => {
  // state.url updates on every client-side navigation
  // use this to trigger loading indicators
  console.log('Navigated to:', state.url);
});
```

### How to roll back

There is no rollback for this — `effect()` still works in 7.0, so the urgent fix is just the rename. The `state.navigation` deprecation is the real risk, and it is forward-only. If your loading indicators break, you need to rewrite them to watch `state.url`.

To find affected code in your plugins:

```bash
# Find effect() usage
grep -r "effect(" wp-content/plugins/ --include="*.js" --include="*.mjs" -l

# Find state.navigation usage
grep -r "state\.navigation" wp-content/plugins/ --include="*.js" --include="*.mjs" -l
```

## Breaking change #4: DataViews — groupByField becomes groupBy

### What breaks

The `groupByField` string property in [DataViews](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2026/03/04/dataviews-dataform-et-al-in-wordpress-7-0/) is replaced with a `groupBy` object. If you're building custom admin screens with DataViews (or if a plugin does), the old property name stops working.

Core screens (Posts, Pages, Media) are already converted. Custom post types are not affected in 7.0, but will be in a future release.

### How to fix it

```typescript
// Before (WordPress 6.9)
const view = { groupByField: 'status' };

// After (WordPress 7.0)
const view = {
  groupBy: {
    field: 'status',
    direction: 'asc',
    showLabel: true,
  },
};
```

The new structure adds sort direction and label visibility, which is why they changed it from a flat string to an object.

### How to roll back

This is a frontend-only change. If your custom DataViews break, pin the old `groupByField` property and add a `@todo` for migration. WordPress 7.0 may still accept the old property with a deprecation warning (verify in your environment). This is low-risk to defer.

## Breaking change #5: Heading block variations

### What breaks

H1 through H6 are now registered as individual block variations instead of a single heading block with a `level` attribute. This breaks:

- `register_block_style` calls targeting `core/heading` — styles may not apply to all variation levels
- Block filters that match on the heading block name without accounting for variations
- Custom block transforms that assume a single heading block type

### How to fix it

Test your `register_block_style('core/heading', ...)` calls in a WordPress 7 environment. If styles don't apply, you may need to register them for each heading variation individually.

There is no automated detection method for this. It requires visual verification in the editor.

### How to roll back

This is a registration change, not a data format change. Your existing heading blocks in content are not affected — they still render correctly. The breakage is in editor-side styling and filtering. If it breaks your workflow, the fix is to update the style registration. There is nothing to roll back to.

## Breaking change #6: PHP 7.4 minimum

### What breaks

WordPress 7 requires PHP 7.4 or higher. If your hosting runs PHP 7.2 or 7.3, the auto-updater will not offer WordPress 7 at all. Your site stays on the 6.9 branch and continues receiving security patches.

This is not a silent failure — it is a hard gate. But it affects hosting environments that have fallen behind, particularly shared hosting providers and legacy enterprise setups.

### How to fix it

Upgrade your PHP version. Most hosting providers offer PHP 8.0+ at this point. If yours doesn't, that is a separate conversation about your hosting situation.

Before upgrading PHP, check your plugins and theme for compatibility. The biggest risks are:

- Plugins using syntax that was deprecated in PHP 7.4+ (rare but possible in older, unmaintained plugins)
- Plugins that have hard-coded PHP version checks that need updating

```bash
# Check your current PHP version
php -v

# Check for deprecated syntax (requires PHPCompatibility ruleset)
composer global require phpcompatibility/php-compatibility
phpcs --standard=PHPCompatibility --runtime-set testVersion 7.4 wp-content/plugins/
```

### How to roll back

You don't need to roll back — if your PHP version is too old, WordPress 7 never installed. If you upgraded PHP and something else broke, the PHP rollback is a hosting-level change, not a WordPress change.

## WordPress 7 and WooCommerce: What we know

WooCommerce powers over 40% of WordPress sites. Zero dedicated articles cover WordPress 7's impact on WooCommerce stores.

Here is what we found in the [WordPress 7.0 dev notes](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2026/02/24/iframed-editor-changes-in-wordpress-7-0/) and the [WooCommerce GitHub repository](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce):

Meta boxes are the main risk. WooCommerce uses classic meta boxes for product data, order details, and custom fields. If these are not migrated to the REST API pattern by the WooCommerce team, every WooCommerce post type loses access to real-time collaboration. Functionally, this is fine — you probably don't need two people co-editing a product description. But it also means the iframed editor may not load for WooCommerce screens, depending on how their blocks are versioned.

The WooCommerce checkout and cart blocks are already on `apiVersion: 3` in recent releases. If your store uses the block-based checkout, the iframe transition should be transparent.

The bigger concern is third-party WooCommerce extensions. Plugins like WooCommerce Subscriptions, WooCommerce Bookings, and payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal) that add their own meta boxes or admin scripts are the real risk. Check each one for WordPress 7 compatibility statements. Run the meta box audit on your WooCommerce plugins specifically:

```bash
# Find WooCommerce-related plugins using classic meta boxes
grep -r "add_meta_box" wp-content/plugins/woo* --include="*.php" -l
```

Action items for store owners:

1. Check your WooCommerce version — 9.x+ has the best WordPress 7 compatibility
2. Audit meta box usage across all WooCommerce extensions (command above)
3. Contact plugin vendors for any extension without a WP7 compatibility statement
4. Test checkout flow on staging — the block-based checkout is the safest path

## The rollback playbook

Every other WordPress 7 guide stops at "test on staging." Here is the rollback plan for when staging passes but production doesn't.

### Before you upgrade

1. **Take a full backup** — files and database. Not just files. WordPress 7 may run database schema changes that a file-only restore won't revert. Use your hosting provider's backup tool, or `wp db export` combined with a full `wp-content` copy.
2. **Document your current state** — run `wp plugin list --status=active` and `wp core version` and save the output. You will need this if you're rebuilding.
3. **Set a rollback deadline** — give yourself 48 hours after upgrading production. If critical issues appear after 48 hours of normal usage, roll back. Don't stretch it to "let's wait and see."

### The rollback process

**Option A: Full backup restore (recommended)**

Restore the pre-upgrade backup entirely. This is the cleanest path because it reverts both files and database.

```bash
# If using WP-CLI and your backup is a SQL dump + file archive:
wp db import pre-upgrade-backup.sql
# Then restore wp-content and wp-includes from your file backup
```

**Option B: WP-CLI core downgrade (partial)**

```bash
wp core download --version=6.9.5 --force
```

This replaces WordPress core files but does **not** revert database changes. If WordPress 7 created new tables (like the collaboration table), they remain. If schema changes affected existing tables, this method leaves you in an inconsistent state. Use this only if you're confident no schema migrations ran.

**Option C: Maintain parallel environments**

If you manage multiple client sites, consider keeping a WordPress 6.9 staging environment running alongside your 7.0 staging environment for the first month. When a plugin breaks on 7.0, you can compare behavior side-by-side instead of guessing whether the issue is WordPress 7 or something else.

### After you roll back

1. Open tickets with the plugin developers whose plugins broke — they need the bug report
2. Set a calendar reminder to retry in 30 days
3. Subscribe to the WordPress 7.0.x minor release announcements — the first point release usually fixes the worst compatibility issues

## Migration audit checklist

Use this to audit your site before upgrading. Each item maps to a breaking change section above.

- [ ] PHP version is 7.4+ (`php -v`)
- [ ] All custom blocks are on `apiVersion: 3` (`grep -r "apiVersion" wp-content/ --include="*.json"`)
- [ ] No plugins use `effect()` from the Interactivity API (`grep -r "effect(" wp-content/plugins/ --include="*.js" -l`)
- [ ] No plugins reference `state.navigation.hasStarted` or `state.navigation.hasFinished`
- [ ] All admin scripts use `enqueue_block_editor_assets`, not `admin_enqueue_scripts`
- [ ] Classic meta boxes are identified (`grep -r "add_meta_box" wp-content/plugins/ --include="*.php" -l`)
- [ ] WooCommerce is version 9.x+ (if applicable)
- [ ] Full backup taken (files + database)
- [ ] Staging environment mirrors production (same plugins, theme, PHP version)
- [ ] Rollback process tested on staging before production upgrade
- [ ] Plugin developers contacted for any extension without a WP7 compatibility statement

## What this means for the WordPress ecosystem

WordPress market share dropped from 65.2% in 2022 to [60.2% in 2026](https://blog.wpodyssey.com/general/wordpress-market-share/). SaaS-based site builders are growing at 32.6% year-over-year. WordPress 7 is a bet that major architectural improvements will reverse that trend. The breaking changes are the cost.

[The Admin Bar's 2026 agency survey](https://theadminbar.com/2026-survey/) found most agencies are budgeting 2-4 weeks of compatibility work per client site for WordPress 7. If you maintain a small number of sites with well-maintained plugins, the upgrade path is straightforward. Follow the audit checklist, test on staging, keep a rollback plan ready.

If you maintain dozens of client sites with varied plugin stacks, the calculus is different. The maintenance burden compounds with every major release, and WordPress 7 is a heavier release than most.

You just read a 2,500-word breaking changes audit. WordPress 8 will need one too. [Frontman](https://frontman.sh) is how developer teams stop doing this — visual AI editing on Next.js and Astro, with none of the upgrade overhead. Your content team edits visually while your codebase stays modern.
