Frontman is an open-source AI coding agent that runs inside your development browser. You chat with it in natural language or point at elements on your page, and it edits your actual source files — with instant hot reload so you see changes immediately.

:::tip[The 30-second mental model]
You describe a change → the agent takes a screenshot of your running app → reads relevant source code → makes edits → your dev server hot-reloads → you see the result. No copy-pasting, no context-switching, no "refresh and check."
:::

## Who uses Frontman?

**Developers** set up Frontman in their project (a one-line integration for Astro, Next.js, or Vite) and use it alongside their existing editor. The agent sees both the rendered page and the source code, so it makes precise, file-level edits that compile and render correctly.

**Designers, PMs, and non-technical teammates** use the chat UI to make changes directly. Select an element, describe what you want ("make this button larger," "change the heading text," "swap the layout to two columns"), and the agent handles the code. No IDE required.

### Setting up Frontman

Start here if Frontman isn't running in your project yet.

| Framework | Install command | Docs |
|-----------|----------------|------|
| **Astro** | `astro add @frontman-ai/astro` | [Astro integration →](/docs/integrations/astro/) |
| **Next.js** | `npx @frontman-ai/nextjs install` | [Next.js integration →](/docs/integrations/nextjs/) |
| **Vite** | `npx @frontman-ai/vite install` | [Vite integration →](/docs/integrations/vite/) |
| **WordPress** | WordPress Plugin Directory (beta) | [WordPress setup →](/docs/integrations/wordpress/) |

Then continue with:

1. **[API Keys & Providers](/docs/api-keys/)** — Configure your AI model with OAuth or a provider API key
